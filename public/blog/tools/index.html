<h2>Quick Start Guide for the JavaScript CLI Tool</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s walk through setting up the <strong>JavaScript CLI Tool</strong> to fetch and create notes.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Install and Set Up the Tool</h3>
<p>Start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/Collected-Notes/tools
cd tools/javascript/cli
npm install
npx tsc
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2: Set Up Your API Token</h3>
<p>To use the CLI tools, you need an API token from Collected Notes. You can generate one by visiting the <a href="https://collectednotes.com/api">API page</a>.</p>
<p>After generating your API token, store it in a <code>.collected-notes</code> file in your home directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &amp;quot;your-api-token&amp;quot; &amp;gt; ~/.collected-notes
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>your-api-token</code> with the actual token you generated from the API page.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Fetch All Sites</h3>
<p>Once you have the CLI set up, you can start interacting with your Collected Notes account. For example, to fetch all the sites associated with your account, use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node dist/index.js get-sites
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 4: Create a New Note</h3>
<p>You can also create a new public note on one of your sites:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node dist/index.js create-note &amp;lt;site_path&amp;gt; &amp;quot;This is a new note!&amp;quot; public
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>&amp;lt;site_path&amp;gt;</code> with the actual path of your site. This command creates a new note with the body &quot;This is a new note!&quot; and sets it to public visibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Collected Notes CLI tools provide a powerful and efficient way to manage your sites and notes programmatically. Whether you want to automate publishing, back up content, or integrate notes into a custom project, the CLI tools have you covered.</p>
