summary: Setting up a new bevy project

## Setup project 


Before we begin setting up Bevy to run in our project that the mininum support version of Rust is the latest stable version. In your cargo toml file add bevy as a dependency 

``` 
[dependencies] bevy = "0.11"

``` 

At the time the version of bevy is 0.11 but you can add whatever the current version is.  If your version isn't the same then some of the code examples will be different. WGPU requires us to put this resolver in our toml file Go into more detail about what this is doing 

```
[workspace] resolver = "2" 

```

For larger games it is recommended that we add in a couple of configurations in order to build faster.  This may not be needed for this project but I will go ahead and add it in 

``` 
# Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode 
[profile.dev] opt-level = 1 
# Enable high optimization for dependencies (incl Bevy), but not our code 
[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3 

``` 
## Get Blank project working 

To get the basic bevy project working we will go to the main.rs file. At the top add the bevy library 

``` 
use bevy::prelude::*; 
``` 
In the main function add in  
``` 
App::new() 
  .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) .run(); 
``` 
If you cargo run this then it will open up a blank window.  This is just the basic setup from here we will add.
