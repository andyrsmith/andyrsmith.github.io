title: Creating a Game Over Screen in Bevy
author: Andy
summary: Game over and starting over.
---

In the previous post I created a start screen, which was really just some text over the current game screen.  This time I will adds some game over text to display after the player dies, and allow for the player to restart the game.

First I created a game over and listen_for_restart system which I added to my main function.  The game over system will display the game over message and the listen_for_restart will wait for a keypress of enter and the restart the game

```
        .add_systems(Update, (game_over, listen_for_restart).run_if(in_state(GameState::GameOver)))

```

I wanted to put this in a different type of schedule besides update because I didn't need to have this function more than once, but couldn't find one besides update and startup, so update will do.

The code for the game_over function is

```
fn game_over(mut commands: Commands,
    query: Query<Entity, With<GameOverMessage>>) {
    let text_style = TextStyle {
        font_size: 20.,
        ..default()
    };

    if query.is_empty() {
        commands.spawn((NodeBundle {
            style: Style {
                width: Val::Percent(100.0),
                height: Val::Percent(100.0),
                flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column,
                justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,
                align_content: AlignContent::Center,
                align_items: AlignItems::Center,
                row_gap: Val::Px(50.),
                ..default()
            },
            ..default()
        }))
        .with_children(|parent| {
            parent.spawn((TextBundle::from_sections([
                TextSection::new("Game Over", text_style.clone()),
            ]), GameOverMessage));
            parent.spawn((TextBundle::from_sections([
                TextSection::new("Press Enter to restart", text_style.clone()),
            ]), GameOverMessage));
            parent.spawn((TextBundle::from_sections([
                TextSection::new("Press ESC to quit", text_style.clone()),
            ]), GameOverMessage));
        });
    }
}
```

I'm displaying the message the same way I did for the start message except I have an if condition before it.  

```
if query.is_empty()
```

This check to see if the message does not exist and spawn the message if so.  Otherwise the message would keep spawning on the screen because it is in the update schedule.  Which is why I didn't want to use the update.

The next system will be the listen_for_restart method
```
fn listen_for_restart(mut commands: Commands,
    keyboard_input: Res<Input<KeyCode>>,   
    query: Query<Entity, With<GameOverMessage>>,
    mut app_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
    zombie_query: Query<(Entity), With<zombies::Zombie>>,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut zombie_wave: ResMut<ZombieWave>
) {
    if keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Return) {
        for text in &query {
            commands.entity(text).despawn_recursive();
        }

        for zombie_entity in &zombie_query {
            commands.entity(zombie_entity).despawn();
        }
        commands.spawn((
            SpriteBundle {
                texture: asset_server.load("sprites/manRed_gun.png"),
                transform: Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(0.,0.,1.)),
                sprite: Sprite {
                    flip_x: true,
                    ..default()
                },
                ..default()
            },
            player::Player,
            movement::Movement {
                last_movement: movement::Direction::UP,
            }
        ));
    
        commands.spawn((SpriteBundle {
            texture: asset_server.load("sprites/zoimbie1_hold.png").clone_weak(),
            transform: Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(150., 0., 1.)),
            ..default()
        },
        zombies::Zombie));
        zombie_wave.0 = 1;
        app_state.set(GameState::Playing);
    }
}
```

This method I wait for the enter button to be pressed and if it is then despawn all enemies, set the zombie wave to 1, respawn the player, and transitions the game state.

The last thing I did was add one more system.

```
        .add_systems(Update, close_on_esc)
```

The close_on_esc is a bultin function that will listen for the esc key to be pressed at anytime and close the game.

The one last thing I will do before calling this project to be done is add a zombie counter.  That will be coming up next.
