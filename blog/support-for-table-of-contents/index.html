                <h1>Support for table of contents</h1>
<p>We just added support for table of contents. This functionality is designed to make navigating markdown documents effortless, by dynamically building a TOC based on your document's headings. Now, readers can quickly locate and access sections, enhancing both readability and organization.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>The TOC feature scans for H1, H2, and H3 headings and creates a structured table of contents to match your document’s layout. To enable this feature, simply add the <code>[TOC]</code> tag to your markdown file where you want the TOC to appear, and let the editor do the rest.</p>
<p>This TOC functionality works seamlessly across both <a href="https://collectednotes.com/blog/support-for-table-of-contents.txt">.txt</a> and <a href="https://collectednotes.com/blog/support-for-table-of-contents.md">.md</a> files. When you include <code>[TOC]</code> in these formats, we’ll generate a rendered TOC, making navigation smoother on any markdown-compatible platform.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use this new special tag:</p>

<h1>Table of Contents Example</h1>
<p>[TOC]</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a sample markdown document created to demonstrate how titles with different heading levels (H1, H2, H3) appear in a markdown file. The purpose is to help generate a Table of Contents (TOC) based on these structured headings.</p>
<p>Markdown files are often used for documentation, and structuring them with different heading levels can help in organizing content effectively.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin with markdown, you simply need a text editor that supports it. Many popular editors, like VS Code, have built-in markdown support and plugins to preview or export markdown files.</p>
<p>Markdown syntax is straightforward and easy to learn. You can add headers, lists, tables, links, and even code blocks with just a few symbols.</p>
<h3>Basic Markdown Syntax</h3>
<p>Markdown syntax is built around simplicity. Here are some basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headers</strong>: Use <code>#</code> symbols to denote headers.</li>
<li><strong>Lists</strong>: Use <code>-</code> for unordered lists or <code>1.</code> for ordered lists.</li>
<li><strong>Bold and Italics</strong>: Use <code>**bold**</code> or <code>_italics_</code> for emphasis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
<p>Once you’re familiar with the basics, you can start exploring more advanced markdown features like embedding images, creating tables, and adding HTML elements directly into your markdown file.</p>
<h3>Embedding Images</h3>
<p>To embed images, use the following syntax: <code>![alt text](URL)</code>. This is helpful for creating visually rich documents without relying on complex formatting.</p>
<h3>Creating Tables</h3>
<p>Creating tables in markdown is simple. Here’s a quick example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Header 1</th>
<th>Header 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Row 1</td>
<td>Row 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Markdown is a flexible, lightweight markup language that is widely used for documentation. With the right structure, you can easily create a Table of Contents that helps readers navigate long documents.</p>
